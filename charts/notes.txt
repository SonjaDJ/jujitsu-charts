The 25 aiki-1 on stanford yellow are consistent (up to some japanese vs. english) with the 25 non-"mat" techniques on the city aiki-1. The 5 "mat" techniques are on the Stanford "ground work" chart, along with additional others currently on stanford charts, but may be move off. The additional stanford groundwork is not taught in SF except perhaps pieces sporadically.
------
Osoto garies are consistent between SF and Stanford for the most part, one minor difference is "front choke, pivot, osoto" vs "attempted front choke, gedan shuto, groin haito, pivot, osoto gari"
---------
The "back breakfall" on stanford current chart is probabl "reverse squat" on old stanford sutemi chart.
The "side breakfall" on stanford current chart is "one leg squat" on old stanford charts.
No sutemi/ukemi is explicit on the sf charts afaik, but common are front, back, one leg squat, simple side, turn pivot...
